## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### Continued development

As I stated in the last challenge I submitted, I wanted to work with and get to know Sass better. This time I did and I think I need a bit more time to figure it out, but I learned a lot. I plan to continue working on it and learn how to best implement more processes to automate my workflow. Maybe next I'd like to work on a larger challenge. This project almost felt too small to worry about using something like Sass. I ended up spending more time setting it up in my environment then I did actually creating the website. Next time the setup should go by a lot smoother now that I understand it better.
